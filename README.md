This is a next JS project

I used the following command to create the application:

# npx create-next-app@latest ./

After that answer some questions and you are good to go

Some other packages:

# npm i bcrypt mongodb mongoose next-auth

--> bcrypt: this one to hash the password when storing it in the database
--> next-auth: This is for the authentication in the project
